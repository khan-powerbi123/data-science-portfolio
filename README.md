A repository showcasing my data analysis projects, including Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy

Project 1: Netflix EDA

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix movies data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Approach:
1. Load the dataset and clean any missing data.
2. Filter movies from the 1990s.
3. Perform statistical analysis to find the most frequent movie duration.
4. Count the number of short action movies (less than 90 minutes).

## Results
- The most frequent movie duration for the 1990s was around 100 minutes.
- There were X number of short action movies in the 1990s.




Project 2 : NYC Public School SAT Analysis

This project involves analyzing New York City public school SAT scores and exploring performance across different schools and boroughs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Approach:
1. Load and clean the dataset of NYC public schools.
2. Filter schools with top-performing math scores.
3. Calculate total SAT scores by summing the math, reading, and writing scores.
4. Identify the top 10 performing schools.
5. Analyze which NYC borough has the highest SAT score variability.

## Results:
- The top-performing schools based on math scores were identified.
- The average SAT score for each borough was calculated, and the borough with the highest standard deviation was highlighted.



## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/khan-powerbi123/repository-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib numpy`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb to explore the project.

# DataCamp Project: Netflix EDA

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix movies data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Approach:
1. Load the dataset and clean any missing data.
2. Filter movies from the 1990s.
3. Perform statistical analysis to find the most frequent movie duration.
4. Count the number of short action movies (less than 90 minutes).

## Results
- The most frequent movie duration for the 1990s was around 100 minutes.
- There were X number of short action movies in the 1990s.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/khan-powerbi123/repository-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib numpy`
3. Run the Python file `netflix_eda.py` or open the Jupyter notebook.
